# Affiniter

Affiniter is a simple Soot extension designed to allow a developer instrument Android apk files.
The instrumentation works by means of introducing extra code into the original file, which make 
the app accept and read command line arguments, make a specific system call and use it to manipulate
the dynamic behavior of the application.
